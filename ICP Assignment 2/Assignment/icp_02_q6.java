When a brick is dropped from a tower, it falls faster and faster until it hits the earth. The
distance it travels is given by d = (1/2) gt2
Here d is in feet, t is the time in seconds, and g is 32.174.
Write a program that asks the user for the number of seconds and then prints out the distance
travelled.
